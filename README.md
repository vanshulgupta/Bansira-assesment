Deploying Node.js "Hello World" with Docker, GITHUB, Helm, and ArgoCD
This project demonstrates deploying a simple Node.js "Hello World" application (from https://github.com/johnpapa/node-hello) on Kubernetes using Docker containers, Helm charts, and ArgoCD for GitOps management.

Project Goals:

Dockerize the application with efficient multi-stage builds.
Automate Docker image building and pushing to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions.
Package the application as a Helm chart for easy deployment on Kubernetes.
Leverage ArgoCD for GitOps based deployment and management.
Project Structure:

Dockerfile: Defines the multi-stage build process for the Node.js application image.
.github/workflows/ (directory): Contains workflows for building and pushing the Docker image using GitHub Actions.
nodejs/ (directory, optional): Contains the Helm chart for the application (see below for details).
Chart.yaml: Defines Helm chart metadata and maintainers.
values.yaml: Holds default configuration values for deployment and service.
templates/: Contains Helm chart templates for deployment and service manifests.
Deployment Steps:

Dockerfile:

Review the provided Dockerfile for multi-stage build details.
Adjust the Dockerfile if needed for your specific application.
GitHub Actions (Optional):

Review the workflow files in .github/workflows/.
These workflows automate building and pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub on code pushes.
You may need to configure Docker Hub credentials within the workflows.
Helm Chart:

The nodejs directory contains a Helm chart for the application.
This provides a structured way to package and deploy the application on Kubernetes.
Refer to the files within hello-world and Helm documentation for customization details.
ArgoCD Deployment:

Create an ArgoCD Application YAML file referencing your Helm chart repository.
Modify the Application YAML with your details (Git repository URL, Kubernetes server name, etc.).
Apply the Application YAML to your ArgoCD server to deploy the application.
Additional Notes:

This is a sample project for demonstration purposes.
You can customize the Dockerfile, Helm chart, and deployment process based on your specific needs.
Refer to the official documentation for Docker, Helm, and ArgoCD for advanced features and configuration options.
Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
Review and customize the Dockerfile if necessary.
Kindly refer the Word documents for screenshots and files.
